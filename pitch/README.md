(Rough outline)

Value prop:

On your three hour layover from SF to Beijing, you're in Schiphol Airport and the Suduko is up.

You like to talk, you are interested in other cultures.

Airports are busy hubs, full of stories.

Why not connect to somebody and hear theirs?

Let's bring real contact back to Schiphol Airport. Streamlined, face-to-face meetups with other travellers.

--

Hey, this guy looks fun. Let's go see if he caught the Ajax game last night.

--

Hmm, she's from Dubai. I have a cousin living there. Let's go for a drink. This is a great way to spend my time.

Business case:

Frequent travelers love to connect, and this app is exclusively available at Schiphol Airport. Don't even think about flying from Brussels instead when you could hear a pitch from your next business partner or meet the love of your life at Schiphol.

More flights from Schiphol. More sales for the Schiphol shops. More human stories. Happier, better connected travellers.
