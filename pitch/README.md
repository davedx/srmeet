Pitch script
==

(Rough outline)

On your three hour layover from SF to Beijing, you're in Schiphol Airport and the Suduko is up.

You like to talk, you are interested in other cultures.

Airports are busy hubs, full of stories.

Why not connect to somebody and hear theirs?

Bring real contact back at Schiphol Airport. Streamlined, face-to-face meetups with other people.

?? World's first in-airport museum

Value prop:

Meet people who could become valuable in your life: a partner?

Business case:

Frequent travelers love to connect, and this is exclusively available at Schiphol Airport. Don't think about flying from Brussels instead when you could hear a pitch from your next business partner or meet the love of your life at Schiphol.

More flights from Schiphol. More sales for the Schiphol shops. More human stories. Happier, better connected travellers.
